			<h2>Reading & Critique</h2>

			<p>
				This visualization seeks to depict the number of new Covid-19 cases in the United States
				from January 2020 until the present day (~January 2022 in this case). 
				It uses a spiral "axis" to denote the passage of time, with one full revolution
				denoting one year; the number of cases is presented as a red band around that axis,
				with the width of the band increasing with higher numbers of cases. There are some
				notable trends in the visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My eye was immediately drawn to the sharp increase in cases that occurred at the end 
					of 2021 and beginning of 2022, as the red band fanned out dramatically. 
					This trend was made more prominent by the fact that it cut out so abruptly, 
					at the present day mark, seeming to suggest that it would continue accelerating 
					outwards if action was not taken.</li>
				<li>There is a notable trough around June and July of 2021, after a period of relatively
					high case numbers around early 2021. The number of cases then increases slowly
					throughout 2021, dips slightly, then increases dramatically at the onset of 2022.</li>
				<li>The radial nature of the graph makes it easy to compare the numbers of new cases 
					at the same time every year (e.g. January of 2020, 2021, and 2022). Additionally, 
					the labeling of the graph draws my attention to the months of January, April, July, 
					and October.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Overall, I think that this visualization does a good job of making its point clear, 
					even to someone who only glances at it quickly: that we are about to reach a peak number 
					of new cases of the Omicron variant. Considering the context of the broader article, 
					I see this aspect of the graphic as very successful; as I mentioned in the previous 
					section, the sharp increase around January 2022 followed by the immediate vertical 
					cutoff is striking visually. However, I do feel like it could have been more clear 
					if the cutoff ended in a fade from red → white or something like that, to drive home 
					the fact that this is an ongoing pandemic.
				</li>
				<li>The visualization is quite sparse in terms of labeling and information, 
					and while I think this helps convey its point in a strong way, I also feel like it 
					could benefit from some slightly more quantitative elements. For example, 
					the red lines, although successful at illustrating broader trends lke troughs and 
					increases, don't really convey much useful information at a micro level. 
					In particular, they tend to "wobble" a lot, depicting what I assume are small 
					fluctuations in data, but I don't think these wobbles add much useful information 
					for the viewer; rather, they make the graphic look less strong and more uncertain. 
					I would have liked to see a few more annotations, maybe noting exactly what the 
					7-day average was in early 2021, or a short note explaining why we saw such a 
					decrease in cases in mid 2021. Similarly, although they provide a legend explaining 
					what band width corresponds to 150K cases, I found it hard to mentally transpose that 
					legend onto the graphic in order to actually determine what the quantities were.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, I think that the spiral-shaped time axis the modeler chose is actually very effective. 
					It immediately makes it clear just how long it's been since COVID-19 first sprang up, something 
					that wouldn't be as visually striking in something like a line graph, and allows us to easily 
					compare statistics across the same time each year. The viewer can either travel "outwards" through 
					time, or "inwards" backwards; either way, they can gather the gist of the data at a glance. 
					However, the decision to make the red bands symmetric about the central black spiral is a little 
					confusing to me; it doesn't seem to serve any informational purpose, and the resulting shape combined 
					with the red color creates a bit of an unnerving graphic form, almost like a wound.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					For this first sketch, I wanted to stick with the spiral axis that the old visualization had,
					while exploring different ways of depicting magnitude of the data. I decided to go 
					with color, since I felt that I could depict gradual changes over time through gradients while still 
					partitioning the circle up into months effectively.
				</li>
				<li>
					It was difficult to choose the palette; I think splitting it up into 7 buckets was too many, and 5 would have been 
					just as effective. I made the highest numbers red to convey a sense of urgency, and because the only part of 
					the graph that would be that bright shade of red would be the sharp increase at the end. This would draw the 
					viewer's eye to that part of the graph, which helps support the main message of the visualization. I also included
					a legend to provide some context to the viewer.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, I omitted all of the months except January and labeled the start of each year. I feel like this graph is 
					successful in conveying the urgency of the January 2022 trend, but it is slightly confusing to read in the middle parts,
					unless the viewer really digs in. However, I like how visually striking it is; I emphasized this by fading the final 
					red part out of the spiral a bit. I also added an arrow at the end to emphasize to the viewer that this is an ongoing, 
					present-day trend.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this sketch, I was inspired by the in-class discussion of small-multiples. I thought that this visualization concept could be 
					particularly effective for this data because it already broken up neatly into chunks (years). I think that layering the three 
					mini-graphs vertically allows the viewer to quickly compare Covid-19 levels across the three years, something that 
					was harder to do in the spiral format.
				</li>
				<li>
					In order to signal to the viewer that the graph continues
					across the small multiples, I added color-coded arrows at the beginnings and ends of the charts. I also annotated them with an estimate 
					of the statistics at the end of each year, just to give the viewer a benchmark. Since the data in 2022 is so short, it gave me room to 
					add a longer annotation on the third chart, explaining the present-day statistic in more detail. I also faded out the red fill color 
					in 2022 to signal that the situation is developing.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, I decided to make the Jan/Dec month labels very light, since I think the way that time is broken up is already pretty understandable. 
					I did add light dotted lines dividing each year into quarters, giving the viewer some vertical anchors.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I returned to the circular axis for this graph, because I wanted to explore the idea of layering all three years' data on top of each other.
					In order to make them more legible, I added a semi-opaque fill to each circle of data, so that the overlapping parts would be darker. I think this strategy 
					works for this dataset since we only have slightly more than two years' worth of data; for three years or more, it would probably start to get confusing.
				</li>
				<li>To indicate the direction of time (clockwise), I placed each year label in a white "flag" pointing to the right. I also took advantage of the 
					large negative space in the middle of the circle to display the title, which I think makes the visualization more visually interesting.
					I originally had some more detailed labeling on the magnitude axis, but I ended up omitting it because I felt like it made the top part of the visualization
					 look too busy. Instead, I chose to just annotate the very last data point, at present-day in January 2022. I think that this draws the user's eye more 
					 effectively and conveys the message of the graph clearly with the upward trend arrow. I also labeled "Jan", but in hindsight, I feel like this was unnecessary - 
					 the viewer probably could have inferred that themselves.
				</li>
				<li>
					I think this visualization succeeds in conveying trends that seem to repeat each year: lower numbers of cases in the middle of the year and
					surges around Dec/Jan. I also think its tear-drop composition makes it more interesting than a rectangular visualization like my previous sketch.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				For my final visualization, I wanted to create a more refined version of my first sketch, incorporating ideas from the other two. 
				Using Adobe Illustrator, I was able to create a much cleaner spiral than my hand-drawn one, and I could tweak the "magnitude" of the spiral to 
				achieve a more balanced composition. Before beginning the actual visualization, I pre-processed the data in Excel to extract and bucket monthly average quantities 
				for the time range we were interested in. My final image differed from the sketch in a few ways:
				<ul>
					<li>
						First, after fiddling around with different color schemes for a while, I decided to use only one color (red) and vary its opacity to indicate magnitude. 
						I think this made the trends in the data easier to understand, and it also created more visual weight in the more opaque red areas, which was 
						what I wanted. My original sketch simply varied hue, which was hard to grasp at a glance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Second, instead of implementing smooth gradients across time, I took the average number of daily cases across each month. This helped 
						make the graphic more clear, especially between years "stacked" on top of each other radially. I probably could have taken it a step further and bucketed by week instead, 
						but I felt that it would create too many micro changes in opacity without adding much useful information. I also omitted the month labels completely, keeping only 
						the year labels, assuming that the viewer would be able to infer that January starts where the year labels are located. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, I adjusted the overall composition: I made the legend slightly curved to match the visual language of the spiral 
						and placed the title in the negative space in the top right. This has the added benefit of the arrow in the spiral graphic pointing directly at the title, 
						so the viewer's eye is directed there immediately.
					</li>
				</ul>
      		</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		I think I was able to address a good amount of the critiques I posed regarding the initial visualization. First, I think that I was able to maintain and even amplify 
		the graphic's message regarding the Omicron spike. By using opacity to indicate magnitude instead of thickness, the January 2022 area of the graph is able to 
		command even more visual weight. I also added a fade from the data out to white, as described in my critiques. However, I had a change of heart regarding annotations 
		and detailing as I was making my sketches and final visualization. Although I originally thought that the graphic could benefit from more notes, I started to realize 
		that adding those details would often make a chart kind of murky and would obscure the focus. For example, I removed the month annotations from my visualization and eliminated the actual radial lines 
		(although they're still implied through the opacity shifts). Finally, I think making the spiral fully filled made it feel more structured, as one of my 
		original critiques of Shaman's graphic was how the spiral and band shapes felt a little arbitrary and tenuous. 
      </p>
	  <p>
		I think the process of "critique by redesign" helped me understand a lot more why Shaman made the decisions they did in the original visualization. It made me 
		realize what affordances exist when working with certain types of data, attempting to convey a certain message. I also realized how important it is to have a 
		clear goal in mind when designing a visualization - basically having something specific to say, so that all the graphic elements can be streamlined to serve that purpose.
